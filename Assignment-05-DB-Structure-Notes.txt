Assignment 05 DB/Document Model structure

Query Needs

1 CRUD functionality on customers, products, orders

2 Record item pruchases or establish this information using queries


One-to-Many via embedded documents

embedded documents for addresses in customer collection (customer details (addresses: [home, shipping]))

Many-to-Many (customer has many ordered products/products ordered by many customers) this is the likely scenario, if the databases scale grew
embedding all ordered products into each customer document may cause more overhead that outweighs the benefits of denormalized data and query efficiency for customers orders
for this reason orders will be stand alone collections and normalized by referencing ObjectIds of cutomers and products

Orders collection will contain an ObjectId for each order, each order will contain the id of the customer who has made the order and the id of the products
