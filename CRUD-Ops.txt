You	should	include	methods for the	each of	CRUD acHviHes for the	different	enHtles.	

For	example,	

for	the	C(create) acHvity you should demonstrate how to	create the	customer document	(personal	
and	address),	and	add	it	to	the	database	using	a	method	insertCustomer(<details>).	

For	the	R	(select	 a	 customer	 and	 output	 (not	 raw	 object)	 the	
details	(log	to	console)	using	findCustomer(<details>).	

For	the	U	(select	a	customer	and	update	three	elements	of	their	personal	(phone,	email,	Title)	and	all	or	any	
of	 their	 address	 data	 using	 updateCustomer(<details>).	 

For	the D (delete)
delete	all	 records	 for	a	customer	matching	a	 specified	email,	phone	and	name	using	deleteCustomer(<details>).	 Similarly,	 you	 need	 to	 perform	 similar	 CRUD	 acHviHes	 for	 Items	 and	 Orders
